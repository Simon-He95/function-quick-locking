Solve vue2 and vue3 non-script setup, thousands of lines of a single file, find the painful pain points of `methods`, and jump into the code directly and quickly through `option` or `ctrl` in `template`ðŸ’¨

This project is not maintained, because it was decided to merge into fast-jump. Considering the functional consistency, code reuse, and the problem of common shortcut keys, it was decided to merge into fast-jump. You are welcome to use fast-jump. If there is any problem, you can raise the issue, and I will solve it as soon as possible.
